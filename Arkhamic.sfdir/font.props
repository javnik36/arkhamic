By contrast,+AAoA-the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to+AAoA-share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free+AAoA-software for all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the+AAoA-GNU General Public License for most of our software; it applies also to+AAoA-any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to+AAoA-your programs, too.+AAoACgAA  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not+AAoA-price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you+AAoA-have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for+AAoA-them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you+AAoA-want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new+AAoA-free programs, and that you know you can do these things.+AAoACgAA  To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you+AAoA-these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have+AAoA-certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software, or if+AAoA-you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.+AAoACgAA  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether+AAoA-gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same+AAoA-freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive+AAoA-or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they+AAoA-know their rights.+AAoACgAA  Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:+AAoA(1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License+AAoA-giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.+AAoACgAA  For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains+AAoA-that there is no warranty for this free software.  For both users' and+AAoA-authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as+AAoA-changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to+AAoA-authors of previous versions.+AAoACgAA  Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run+AAoA-modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer+AAoA-can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of+AAoA-protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic+AAoA-pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products for individuals to+AAoA-use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we+AAoA-have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice for those+AAoA-products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we+AAoA-stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions+AAoA-of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.+AAoACgAA  Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.+AAoA-States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of+AAoA-software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to+AAoA-avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could+AAoA-make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that+AAoA-patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.+AAoACgAA  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and+AAoA-modification follow.+AAoACgAA                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS+AAoACgAA  0. Definitions.+AAoACgAA  +ACIA-This License+ACIA refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.+AAoACgAA  +ACIA-Copyright+ACIA also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of+AAoA-works, such as semiconductor masks.+AAoACgAA  +ACIA-The Program+ACIA refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this+AAoA-License.  Each licensee is addressed as +ACIA-you+ACIA.  +ACIA-Licensees+ACIA and+AAoAIgAA-recipients+ACIA may be individuals or organizations.+AAoACgAA  To +ACIA-modify+ACIA a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work+AAoA-in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an+AAoA-exact copy.  The resulting work is called a +ACIA-modified version+ACIA of the+AAoA-earlier work or a work +ACIA-based on+ACIA the earlier work.+AAoACgAA  A +ACIA-covered work+ACIA means either the unmodified Program or a work based+AAoA-on the Program.+AAoACgAA  To +ACIA-propagate+ACIA a work means to do anything with it that, without+AAoA-permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for+AAoA-infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a+AAoA-computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,+AAoA-distribution (with or without modification), making available to the+AAoA-public, and in some countries other activities as well.+AAoACgAA  To +ACIA-convey+ACIA a work means any kind of propagation that enables other+AAoA-parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through+AAoA-a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.+AAoACgAA  An interactive user interface displays +ACIA-Appropriate Legal Notices+ACIACgAA-to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible+AAoA-feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)+AAoA-tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the+AAoA-extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the+AAoA-work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If+AAoA-the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a+AAoA-menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.+AAoACgAA  1. Source Code.+AAoACgAA  The +ACIA-source code+ACIA for a work means the preferred form of the work+AAoA-for making modifications to it.  +ACIA-Object code+ACIA means any non-source+AAoA-form of a work.+AAoACgAA  A +ACIA-Standard Interface+ACIA means an interface that either is an official+AAoA-standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of+AAoA-interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that+AAoA-is widely used among developers working in that language.+AAoACgAA  The +ACIA-System Libraries+ACIA of an executable work include anything, other+AAoA-than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of+AAoA-packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major+AAoA-Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that+AAoA-Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an+AAoA-implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A+AAoAIgAA-Major Component+ACIA, in this context, means a major essential component+AAoA(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system+AAoA(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to+AAoA-produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.+AAoACgAA  The +ACIA-Corresponding Source+ACIA for a work in object code form means all+AAoA-the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable+AAoA-work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to+AAoA-control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's+AAoA-System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free+AAoA-programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but+AAoA-which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source+AAoA-includes interface definition files associated with source files for+AAoA-the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically+AAoA-linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,+AAoA-such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those+AAoA-subprograms and other parts of the work.+AAoACgAA  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users+AAoA-can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding+AAoA-Source.+AAoACgAA  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that+AAoA-same work.+AAoACgAA  2. Basic Permissions.+AAoACgAA  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of+AAoA-copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated+AAoA-conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited+AAoA-permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a+AAoA-covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its+AAoA-content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your+AAoA-rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.+AAoACgAA  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not+AAoA-convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains+AAoA-in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose+AAoA-of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you+AAoA-with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with+AAoA-the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do+AAoA-not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works+AAoA-for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction+AAoA-and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of+AAoA-your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.+AAoACgAA  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under+AAoA-the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10+AAoA-makes it unnecessary.+AAoACgAA  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.+AAoACgAA  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological+AAoA-measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article+AAoA-11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or+AAoA-similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such+AAoA-measures.+AAoACgAA  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid+AAoA-circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention+AAoA-is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to+AAoA-the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or+AAoA-modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's+AAoA-users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of+AAoA-technological measures.+AAoACgAA  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.+AAoACgAA  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you+AAoA-receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and+AAoA-appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;+AAoA-keep intact all notices stating that this License and any+AAoA-non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;+AAoA-keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all+AAoA-recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.+AAoACgAA  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,+AAoA-and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.+AAoACgAA  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.+AAoACgAA  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to+AAoA-produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the+AAoA-terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:+AAoACgAA    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified+AAoA    it, and giving a relevant date.+AAoACgAA    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is+AAoA    released under this License and any conditions added under section+AAoA    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to+AAoA    +ACIA-keep intact all notices+ACIA.+AAoACgAA    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this+AAoA    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This+AAoA    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7+AAoA    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,+AAoA    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no+AAoA    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not+AAoA    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.+AAoACgAA    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display+AAoA    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive+AAoA    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your+AAoA    work need not make them do so.+AAoACgAA  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent+AAoA-works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,+AAoA-and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,+AAoA-in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an+AAoAIgAA-aggregate+ACIA if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not+AAoA-used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users+AAoA-beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work+AAoA-in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other+AAoA-parts of the aggregate.+AAoACgAA  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.+AAoACgAA  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms+AAoA-of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the+AAoA-machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,+AAoA-in one of these ways:+AAoACgAA    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product+AAoA    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the+AAoA    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium+AAoA    customarily used for software interchange.+AAoACgAA    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product+AAoA    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a+AAoA    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as+AAoA    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product+AAoA    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a+AAoA    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the+AAoA    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical+AAoA    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no+AAoA    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this+AAoA    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the+AAoA    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.+AAoACgAA    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the+AAoA    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This+AAoA    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and+AAoA    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord+AAoA    with subsection 6b.+AAoACgAA    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated+AAoA    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the+AAoA    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no+AAoA    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the+AAoA    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to+AAoA    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source+AAoA    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)+AAoA    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain+AAoA    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the+AAoA    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the+AAoA    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is+AAoA    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.+AAoACgAA    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided+AAoA    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding+AAoA    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no+AAoA    charge under subsection 6d.+AAoACgAA  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded+AAoA-from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be+AAoA-included in conveying the object code work.+AAoACgAA  A +ACIA-User Product+ACIA is either (1) a +ACIA-consumer product+ACIA, which means any+AAoA-tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,+AAoA-or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation+AAoA-into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,+AAoA-doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular+AAoA-product received by a particular user, +ACIA-normally used+ACIA refers to a+AAoA-typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status+AAoA-of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user+AAoA-actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product+AAoA-is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial+AAoA-commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent+AAoA-the only significant mode of use of the product.+AAoACgAA  +ACIA-Installation Information+ACIA for a User Product means any methods,+AAoA-procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install+AAoA-and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from+AAoA-a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must+AAoA-suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object+AAoA-code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because+AAoA-modification has been made.+AAoACgAA  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or+AAoA-specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as+AAoA-part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the+AAoA-User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a+AAoA-fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the+AAoA-Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied+AAoA-by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply+AAoA-if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install+AAoA-modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has+AAoA-been installed in ROM).+AAoACgAA  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a+AAoA-requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates+AAoA-for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for+AAoA-the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a+AAoA-network may be denied when the modification itself materially and+AAoA-adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and+AAoA-protocols for communication across the network.+AAoACgAA  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,+AAoA-in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly+AAoA-documented (and with an implementation available to the public in+AAoA-source code form), and must require no special password or key for+AAoA-unpacking, reading or copying.+AAoACgAA  7. Additional Terms.+AAoACgAA  +ACIA-Additional permissions+ACIA are terms that supplement the terms of this+AAoA-License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.+AAoA-Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall+AAoA-be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent+AAoA-that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions+AAoA-apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately+AAoA-under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by+AAoA-this License without regard to the additional permissions.+AAoACgAA  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option+AAoA-remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of+AAoA-it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own+AAoA-removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place+AAoA-additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,+AAoA-for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.+AAoACgAA  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you+AAoA-add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of+AAoA-that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:+AAoACgAA    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the+AAoA    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or+AAoACgAA    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or+AAoA    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal+AAoA    Notices displayed by works containing it; or+AAoACgAA    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or+AAoA    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in+AAoA    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or+AAoACgAA    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or+AAoA    authors of the material; or+AAoACgAA    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some+AAoA    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or+AAoACgAA    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that+AAoA    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of+AAoA    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for+AAoA    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on+AAoA    those licensors and authors.+AAoACgAA  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered +ACIA-further+AAoA-restrictions+ACIA within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you+AAoA-received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is+AAoA-governed by this License along with a term that is a further+AAoA-restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains+AAoA-a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this+AAoA-License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms+AAoA-of that license document, provided that the further restriction does+AAoA-not survive such relicensing or conveying.+AAoACgAA  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you+AAoA-must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the+AAoA-additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating+AAoA-where to find the applicable terms.+AAoACgAA  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the+AAoA-form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;+AAoA-the above requirements apply either way.+AAoACgAA  8. Termination.+AAoACgAA  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly+AAoA-provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or+AAoA-modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under+AAoA-this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third+AAoA-paragraph of section 11).+AAoACgAA  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your+AAoA-license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)+AAoA-provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and+AAoA-finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright+AAoA-holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means+AAoA-prior to 60 days after the cessation.+AAoACgAA  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is+AAoA-reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the+AAoA-violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have+AAoA-received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that+AAoA-copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after+AAoA-your receipt of the notice.+AAoACgAA  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the+AAoA-licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under+AAoA-this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently+AAoA-reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same+AAoA-material under section 10.+AAoACgAA  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.+AAoACgAA  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or+AAoA-run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work+AAoA-occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission+AAoA-to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,+AAoA-nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or+AAoA-modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do+AAoA-not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a+AAoA-covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.+AAoACgAA  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.+AAoACgAA  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically+AAoA-receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and+AAoA-propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible+AAoA-for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.+AAoACgAA  An +ACIA-entity transaction+ACIA is a transaction transferring control of an+AAoA-organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an+AAoA-organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered+AAoA-work results from an entity transaction, each party to that+AAoA-transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever+AAoA-licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could+AAoA-give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the+AAoA-Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if+AAoA-the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.+AAoACgAA  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the+AAoA-rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may+AAoA-not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of+AAoA-rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation+AAoA(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that+AAoA-any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for+AAoA-sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.+AAoACgAA  11. Patents.+AAoACgAA  A +ACIA-contributor+ACIA is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this+AAoA-License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The+AAoA-work thus licensed is called the contributor's +ACIA-contributor version+ACIA.+AAoACgAA  A contributor's +ACIA-essential patent claims+ACIA are all patent claims+AAoA-owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or+AAoA-hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted+AAoA-by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,+AAoA-but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a+AAoA-consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For+AAoA-purposes of this definition, +ACIA-control+ACIA includes the right to grant+AAoA-patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of+AAoA-this License.+AAoACgAA  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free+AAoA-patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to+AAoA-make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and+AAoA-propagate the contents of its contributor version.+AAoACgAA  In the following three paragraphs, a +ACIA-patent license+ACIA is any express+AAoA-agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent+AAoA(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to+AAoA-sue for patent infringement).  To +ACIA-grant+ACIA such a patent license to a+AAoA-party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a+AAoA-patent against the party.+AAoACgAA  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,+AAoA-and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone+AAoA-to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a+AAoA-publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,+AAoA-then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so+AAoA-available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the+AAoA-patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner+AAoA-consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent+AAoA-license to downstream recipients.  +ACIA-Knowingly relying+ACIA means you have+AAoA-actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the+AAoA-covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work+AAoA-in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that+AAoA-country that you have reason to believe are valid.+AAoACgAA  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or+AAoA-arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a+AAoA-covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties+AAoA-receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify+AAoA-or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license+AAoA-you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered+AAoA-work and works based on it.+AAoACgAA  A patent license is +ACIA-discriminatory+ACIA if it does not include within+AAoA-the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is+AAoA-conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are+AAoA-specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered+AAoA-work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is+AAoA-in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment+AAoA-to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying+AAoA-the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the+AAoA-parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory+AAoA-patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work+AAoA-conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily+AAoA-for and in connection with specific products or compilations that+AAoA-contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,+AAoA-or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.+AAoACgAA  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting+AAoA-any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may+AAoA-otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.+AAoACgAA  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.+AAoACgAA  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or+AAoA-otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not+AAoA-excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a+AAoA-covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this+AAoA-License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may+AAoA-not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you+AAoA-to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey+AAoA-the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this+AAoA-License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.+AAoACgAA  13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.+AAoACgAA  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have+AAoA-permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed+AAoA-under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single+AAoA-combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this+AAoA-License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,+AAoA-but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,+AAoA-section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the+AAoA-combination as such.+AAoACgAA  14. Revised Versions of this License.+AAoACgAA  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of+AAoA-the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will+AAoA-be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to+AAoA-address new problems or concerns.+AAoACgAA  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the+AAoA-Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General+AAoA-Public License +ACIA-or any later version+ACIA applies to it, you have the+AAoA-option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered+AAoA-version or of any later version published by the Free Software+AAoA-Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the+AAoA-GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published+AAoA-by the Free Software Foundation.+AAoACgAA  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future+AAoA-versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's+AAoA-public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you+AAoA-to choose that version for the Program.+AAoACgAA  Later license versions may give you additional or different+AAoA-permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any+AAoA-author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a+AAoA-later version.+AAoACgAA  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.+AAoACgAA  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY+AAoA-APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT+AAoA-HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM +ACIA-AS IS+ACIA WITHOUT WARRANTY+AAoA-OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,+AAoA-THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR+AAoA-PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM+AAoA-IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF+AAoA-ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.+AAoACgAA  16. Limitation of Liability.+AAoACgAA  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING+AAoA-WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS+AAoA-THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY+AAoA-GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE+AAoA-USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF+AAoA-DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD+AAoA-PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),+AAoA-EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF+AAoA-SUCH DAMAGES.+AAoACgAA  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.+AAoACgAA  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided+AAoA-above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,+AAoA-reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates+AAoA-an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the+AAoA-Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a+AAoA-copy of the Program in return for a fee.+AAoACgAA                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS+AAoACgAA            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs+AAoACgAA  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest+AAoA-possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it+AAoA-free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.+AAoACgAA  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest+AAoA-to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively+AAoA-state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least+AAoA-the +ACIA-copyright+ACIA line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.+AAoACgAA    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>+AAoA    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>+AAoACgAA    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify+AAoA    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by+AAoA    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or+AAoA    (at your option) any later version.+AAoACgAA    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,+AAoA    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of+AAoA    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Of course, your program's commands+AAoA-might be different; for a GUI interface, you would use an +ACIA-about box+ACIA.+AAoACgAA  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,+AAoA-if any, to sign a +ACIA-copyright disclaimer+ACIA for the program, if necessary.+AAoA-For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU GPL, see+AAoA<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.+AAoACgAA  The GNU General Public License does not permit incorporating your program+AAoA-into proprietary programs.
