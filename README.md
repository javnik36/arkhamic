# Arkhamic font
![Title](/gh-title.png)

Arkhamic is font that expands [Teutonic](http://www.peter-wiegel.de) font with more latin glyphs. For now I focused mainly on glyphs used in Polish, Czech, Slovak and Hungarian. If you wish to add characters from YOUR language create a new issue - I will check what can be done.
